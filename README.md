# Buddy

> The Stacks CLI.

## Features

- Access to all Stacks Buddy commands
- Extremely lightweight
- Cross-platform
- No dependencies
- Multiple implementation options (JavaScript, QuickJS, Rust)

## Install

```bash
bun install -d @stacksjs/buddy
```

<!-- _Alternatively, you can install:_

```bash
brew install buddy # wip
pkgx install buddy # wip
``` -->

## Usage

```bash
buddy new my-project
buddy help
buddy version
```

## Build From Source

```bash
# Build the JavaScript version
bun run compile

# Build the Rust version
bun run compile:rust
```

> [!NOTE]
> QuickJS is required to build the JavaScript CLI. Soon, we expect to require it as a dependency via pkgx.

## Implementation Options

### JavaScript (QuickJS)

The CLI is implemented in JavaScript and can be compiled to a standalone executable using QuickJS.

```bash
# Build the JavaScript version
bun run compile

# Build for all platforms
bun run compile:all
```

### Rust

The CLI is also implemented in Rust for native performance and smaller binary size.

```bash
# Build the Rust version for current platform
bun run compile:rust

# Build for current platform + all platform binaries
bun run compile:rust:all
```

The Rust version is available at `bin/buddy-rust` and platform-specific binaries will be created at `bin/buddy-rust-[platform]` (e.g., `bin/buddy-rust-darwin-arm64` for macOS ARM64).

For cross-compilation, you'll need to set up Rust properly:

```bash
# Set up default toolchain
rustup default stable

# Install cargo-zigbuild for cross-compilation
cargo install cargo-zigbuild

# Install required targets
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

Note: Cross-compilation may not work on all systems and requires additional dependencies.

### Wrapper Script

A wrapper script is provided that can choose between the JavaScript and Rust versions:

```bash
# Use the JavaScript version (default)
./buddy-wrapper

# Use the Rust version with a flag
./buddy-wrapper --use-rust

# Use the Rust version with an environment variable
BUDDY_USE_RUST=true ./buddy-wrapper
```

The wrapper script will:

1. Use the Rust version if `--use-rust` flag is provided or `BUDDY_USE_RUST=true` environment variable is set
2. Fall back to the QuickJS version if available
3. Fall back to the original JavaScript implementation if neither is available

## Testing

```bash
bun test
```
